Project Description
This project is an implementation of a simplified version of the popular online accommodation marketplace, AirBnB. The focus is on creating a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with the application.

Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a Python-based CLI that enables users to manage and interact with the AirBnB clone. It supports various commands for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving information about users, places, amenities, and more.

How to Start
To start the AirBnB clone command interpreter, follow these steps:

*Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/airbnb-clone.git

*Navigate to the project directory:
cd airbnb-clone

*Run the command interpreter:
./console.py

How to Use
Once the command interpreter is running, you can enter various commands to interact with the AirBnB clone. The general syntax for commands is as follows:

scss
(command) (options)
For example, to create a new user, you can use the following command:

sql
create User

To display a list of available commands and their descriptions, you can use the help command:

Examples
>Create a new user:
create User

>Show all available commands:
help

>Display all users:
all User

>Update user information:
update User 1234-5678 first_name "John" last_name "Doe"

>Retrieve information about a specific place:
show Place 9876-5432

>Delete a user:
destroy User 1234-5678
